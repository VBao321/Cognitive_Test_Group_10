# Cognitive Test Group 10

This project, developed as part of the BIOS0030 course, is designed to assess various cognitive abilities through a series of tests. Each test focuses on a different aspect of cognitive functioning, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the participants' skills. The repository contains all necessary code to administer these tests.

## Tests Included

The project comprises four distinct tests, each targeting a specific cognitive skill:

1. **ANS Test**: Authored by Lihao Tao, this test evaluates the ability to quickly and accurately estimate the number of items in a visual display.

2. **Math Ability Test**: Developed by Fatin Qistina Mohd Faizal, this test measures mathematical computation skills and the ability to recall and apply sequential calculation steps.

3. **Memory Test**: Created by Hazim Mohammad Tarmizi, this test assesses memory capabilities, focusing on the recall of colors and spatial positions within an image matrix.

4. **Spatial Reasoning Test**: Written by Weiye Bao, this test evaluates the ability to manipulate and understand three-dimensional space, identifying images that cannot be derived from rotating a given three-dimensional figure.

## Data Collection

For each test, participants' accuracy rates and response times are recorded alongside anonymous demographic information, including gender, age, exercise frequency, and fatigue levels (measured using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale). This data is collected for educational purposes, aiming to practice data analysis and visualization skills within the context of cognitive science.

## Test Dissemination via MyBinder.org

The tests are made accessible online through [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), allowing for a wider reach and participation.
