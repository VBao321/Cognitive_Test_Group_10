# Math Ability Test Code v1.0.0

Developed by Fatin Qistina Mohd Faizal, the Math Ability Test is designed to evaluate the mathematical abilities of university students in London. This document provides an overview of the test, detailing its format and the nature of data collection.

## Test Description

The test comprises 15 mathematical questions, each involving a sequence of calculation steps displayed for 2 seconds per step. Participants are required to memorize these steps and input the final calculation result after the steps are no longer visible. The accuracy of the answers and the time taken to respond are recorded for each question.

## Data Collection

To support educational objectives, particularly in data analysis and visualization, the test collects anonymous data on:

- User ID (anonymous)
- Gender
- Age
- Exercise frequency
- Fatigue state, assessed using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

This information is gathered with the intent to analyze and understand the relationship between these variables and mathematical ability.
