# Memory Test Code v1.0.0

Crafted by Hazim Mohammad Tarmizi, the Memory Test aims to assess the memory capabilities of university students in London. This document outlines the structure of the test and the methodology behind data collection.

## Test Description

The Memory Test is structured around four main questions, each comprising a matrix of images. Participants are tasked with memorizing as many details as possible about the colors and relative positions of the images within a 20-second timeframe. Following this memorization phase, participants answer five related questions each with a 5-second time limit to test their recall of the images. The test measures both the accuracy of the participants' answers and the time they take to respond.

## Data Collection

In line with its educational objectives, the test gathers anonymous data on the following:

- User ID (anonymous)
- Gender
- Age
- Frequency of exercise
- Fatigue level, measured using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

This data is collected to facilitate educational practices in data analysis and visualization, aiming to understand how memory performance can be correlated with various demographic and personal factors.
