# ANS Test Code v1.0.0

The ANS Test code, authored by Lihao Tao, is designed for conducting a test to assess the Approximate Number System (ANS) abilities of university students in London. This document provides a brief overview of the test and its implementation.

## Test Description

The test challenges participants to select the image with a higher count of randomly placed dots. These images flash on the screen for a duration of 0.75 seconds, with a 3-second time limit given for each response. Between each question, there is a 1.5-second interval to prepare for the next one. Participant's accuracy and response time in these quick-paced decisions on number sensing are recorded.

## Data Collection

During the test, several pieces of anonymous information are collected for each participant, including:

- User ID (anonymous)
- Gender
- Age
- Frequency of exercise
- Fatigue state, assessed using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

This data is gathered with the purpose of supporting educational practices in data analysis and visualization.
