# Spatial Reasoning Test Code v1.0.0

The Spatial Reasoning Test, developed by Weiye Bao, is crafted to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of university students in London. This document outlines the test's structure and its implementation details.

## Test Description

Participants are presented with a series of 9 spatial reasoning questions, each involving a randomly generated three-dimensional cybe arrangement. The task is to identify, from four options (A, B, C, D), which two-dimensional image cannot be obtained by rotating the given three-dimensional figure. A time limit of 25 seconds is allocated for answering each question, aiming to assess not only accuracy but also the speed of spatial reasoning.

## Data Collection

The test is designed to collect anonymous data from each participant, which includes:

- User ID (anonymous)
- Gender
- Age
- Frequency of exercise
- Fatigue state, as measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale

This information is intended to be used for educational purposes, particularly in practicing data analysis and visualization techniques.
